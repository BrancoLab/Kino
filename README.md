- [ ] add method to define what's PAW and to extract steps
- [x] add method to define what's main body axis and get angle/length
- [x] add method to get egocentric coordinates of all BPS
- [ ] add method to progect a trajectory (e.g. COM) from allo -> ego
- [ ] add animation with allog/ego point of views
- [ ] add vectors to animations
- [ ] add bones to animatios (also to mark paws positions)


- [ ] make sure core functionality works without paws
- [ ] extract basic quantities from the CoM trajectory (speed, curvature, angular velocity...)
