- [x] add method to define what's PAW and to extract steps
- [x] add method to define what's main body axis and get angle/length
- [x] add method to get egocentric coordinates of all BPS
- [x] add method to progect a trajectory (e.g. COM) from allo -> ego
- [x] add animation with allog/ego point of views
- [x] add vectors to animations
- [x] add bones to animatios (also to mark paws positions)
- [x] add scalars animation

- [ ] make sure core functionality works without paws
- [x] extract basic quantities from the CoM trajectory (speed, curvature, angular velocity...)
- [ ] document what we have so far
